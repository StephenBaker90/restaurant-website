	<h1>Hello!</h1>
	<p>Welcome, all you travelers of the seas! Welcome, to the Tangaroa Cafe!</p>
<br>
	<p>We're sure the voyage was long, but hope it was at least safe. Regardless, the Tangaroa Cafe is your one-stop shop to sit and rest on a safe, comfortable island in a boundless ocean of work, school, and whatever else troubles daily life. Of course, for those more privileged, the Cafe still makes an excellent place to sit back and enjoy the horizon's glow.</p>
<br>
	<p>This is all well and good, but what exactly does the Tangaroa Cafe offer? Well, the Cafe offers a selection of food and drink from across what was once Polynesia, which means our dishes hail from Hawaii, Tahiti, and other Pacific islands. If this is your first time trying Hawaiian or the more broader Polynesian cuisine, you're in for a truly unique experience!</p>
