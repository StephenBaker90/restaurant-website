	<p>Welcome, all you travelers of the seas! Welcome, to the Tangaroa Café!</p>
	
	<p>We're sure the voyage was long, but hope it was at least safe. Regardless, the Tangaroa Café is your one-stop shop to sit and rest on a safe, comfortable island in a boundless ocean of work, school, and whatever else troubles daily life. Of course, for those more privileged, the Café still makes an excellent place to sit back and enjoy the horizon's glow.</p>

	<p>This is all well and good, but what exactly does the Tangaroa Café offer? Well, the Café offers a selection of food and drink from across what was once Polynesia, which means food from Hawaii,</p>
